```{r}
EyeHairFreq <- apply(HairEyeColor, c("Eye", "Hair"), sum) # sum across sex
EyeHairProp <- EyeHairFreq / sum(EyeHairFreq) # joint proportions. Table 4.1
show(round(EyeHairProp, 2))
```

```{r}
HairFreq <- apply(HairEyeColor, c("Hair"), sum) # sum across sex and eye
HairProp <- HairFreq /  sum(HairFreq) # marginal proportions. Table 4.1
show(round(HairProp, 2))
```

```{r}
EyeFreq <- apply(HairEyeColor, c("Eye"), sum) # sum across sex and eye
EyeProp <- EyeFreq / sum(EyeFreq) # marginal proportions. Table 4.1
show(round(EyeProp, 2))
```

```{r}
EyeHairProp["Blue",] / EyeProp["Blue"] # conditional prob. Table 4.2
